# MedLaunch-Docs
Repo for MedLaunch documentation - https://medlaunch.info/documentation

MedLaunch Documentation is build using Grav CMS. This repo is just the 'pages' folder structure that contains all markdown.

A understanding of Markdown in general is required before submitting pull requests.
A basic familiarity with [GRAV CMS](https://learn.getgrav.org/) would be useful, but not strictly neccessary.

This documentation site uses the [learn2](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-learn2) GRAV theme, so a basic understanding of how page headers need to be formatted is desireable.
