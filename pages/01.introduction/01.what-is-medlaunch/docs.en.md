MedLaunch is an open source ([MIT](https://github.com/Asnivor/MedLaunch/blob/master/MedLaunch/LICENSE)) Windows frontend for the multi-system emulator, [Mednafen](https://mednafen.github.io/).


## So what is Mednafen?

Mednafen is an open source ([GNU GPLv2)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) cross-platform command-line-driven (no UI) multi-system emulator that currently emulates the following systems:

* Atari Lynx
* Neo Geo Pocket (and Pocket Color)
* Bandai WonderSwan
* Nintendo GameBoy (and GameBoy Color)
* Nintendo GameBoy Advance
* Nintendo Entertainment System/Famicom Disk System
* Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super Famicom
* Nintendo Virtual Boy
* NEC PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16 (and PCE-CD)
* NEC SuperGrafx
* NEC PC-FX
* Sega Game Gear
* Sega Genesis/Megadrive
* Sega Master System
* Sega Saturn (experimental, x86_64 only)
* Sony PlayStation (PSX)

For most emulated systems it supports save states and real-time game rewinding.

## So why do I need a frontend?

You don't. But most people will find a frontend easier.

Mednafen is launched from the command-line and utilises config txt files. Without a frontend you have to edit the config file(s) manually and launch mednafen from the command-line every time specifying the path to the ROM/Disc Image that you wish to run. Or you can create batch files for each game.
